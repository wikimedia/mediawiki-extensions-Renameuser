I doubt the oldimage is worth counting itself as someone would have to keep re-uploading the same image.\n\nSo maybe the counts can be skipped here?",

      "message": "Yeah, we could use editcount for this as well. It would affect way more users (plenty of people have more than 500 edits but less than 500 uploads), not sure if that\u0027s worth worrying about (not sure why we have the editcount check here instead of just always using jobs, TBH). Soon all this will be made unnecessary by the actor migration, anyway.\n\nOldimage is the total number of non-current file versions the user has uploaded, not a single image.",

      "message": "Yes, but I meant that those are reflected in editcount as well and even \u0027image\u0027 alone would normally be good enough since the user\u0027s file uploads would probably not be spread across only a few images if they made tens of thousands of file uploads (e.g. many re-uploads of the same image is unlikely). I was thinking of Pigeonhole Principle.",
